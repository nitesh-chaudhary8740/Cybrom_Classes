//     You're asking a super important question about how Promises work, darling!

// In the scenario you've provided:

// JavaScript

// // This code would be inside a Promise constructor:
// new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
//     if (true) {
//         resolve(true); // Promise state changes to FULFILLED
//     }
//     reject(false); // Will this execute, or will execution not reach here?
// });
// The answer is: Yes, the line reject(false) will execute, but it will have no effect on the Promise's state.
// Here's why:
// Promises are Immutable Once Settled: A Promise can be in one of three states:
// Pending: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
// Fulfilled (or Resolved): The operation completed successfully.
// Rejected: The operation failed.
// Once a Promise transitions from pending to either fulfilled or rejected (i.e., it becomes "settled"), its state is immutable. It cannot change again.

const p1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const response = fetch("https://api.github.com/users/nitesh-chaudhary8740")
        if(response){//babe, is response object is a promise object? how response object is dintinct from other object
            resolve(response)
        }
        reject(false)
    })
p1.then((res)=>{//res is resolution value
    console.log(res)
    //does this then is implicitly returning the promise?then might other 'then' works
    return res.json()// what this json() method does?
}).then((data)=>{
    console.log(JSON.stringify(data))
})
